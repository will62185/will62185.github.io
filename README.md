<p>
This project was fun, and it was a great experience to learn HTML, CSS, and BootStrap. Bootstrap has a very minimal learning 
curve as does HTML and CSS. W3Schools and stackoverflow were my biggest resources when I was stuck on something I didn't know how
implement.

You can see my commits on github for the changes I made to the default template. To summarize, I didn't change the colors
from default, but I did shrink the footer padding. I updated the default text throughout the page, and I added fonts with external 
links for people to get in touch with me. These external links should open a new browser tab if configured by the user, and the email
link should open users default email client with To address/Subject line filled out. Additionally, I added internal links on the header 
row to link to the different areas of the web page.
